# Spearmint-Customizer
A script that installs all of the things you were going to do anyway on Ubuntu.

# How to Install
## Method 1
This method is easier for people who have never used the terminal, but takes longer. If you are willing to use the terminal to open file locations, use method 2.

Open the file "setup.sh" and copy all of the lines **in order and that do not include a "#" at the beginning** into the terminal.

When it prompts you to press "y or n" be sure to choose "y"
(Example will be placed here)
## Method 2
Open up terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T) and type `cd /home/"username"/"where you saved the file"/spearmint-customizer-master`.
Of course replace "username" and "where you saved the file" as the actual locations.

Then type `sudo chmod 775 setup.sh` to make the setup executable.

Now, type `./setup.sh` to start the installer.

Make sure to press "y" when prompted during the installer.
You did it! hooray!
