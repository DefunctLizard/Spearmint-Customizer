# Spearmint-OS
A script that installs all of the things you were going to do anyway on Ubuntu.

# How to Install
Open up terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T) and type `cd /home/"username"/"where you saved the file"/spearmint-customizer-master`.

Of course replace "username" and "where you saved the file" as the actual locations.

Then type `chmod 775 setup.sh` to make the setup executable.

Now, type `./setup.sh` to start the installer.

Make sure to press "y" when prompted during the installer.

You did it! hooray!
